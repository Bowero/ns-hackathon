The Java application that functions as the server for the NS Games.

This application is far from bug free, but should be functional enough to play a simple game. 

## Requirements
There are a few requirements to use this server. If you do not have these, you will have to find your own workaround.

+ `Java Runtime Environment` (at least version `11`)
+ `Java Development Kit`
+ `Apache Maven`

## Boot up the server
To run it, you just have to run the following command from the `root` directory:

```console
mvn spring-boot:run
```
